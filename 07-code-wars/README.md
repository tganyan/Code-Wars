In this challenge, we were asked to identify and remove all vowels from a string. Thanks to regex, this one was fairly quick and easy for us to figure out (id vowels with regex, us .replace() to remove them).

Description of Kata: Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
